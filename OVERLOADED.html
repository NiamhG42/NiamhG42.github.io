				<p>Overloaded is designed to help players empathise with people who experience sensory overload.
				</p><h2 class="subheading">Context: Sensory Overload</h2>
				<p>Sensory overload is when you receive more sensory input than your brain can process. It can be overwhelming and exhausting. Sometimes it even triggers the fight-flight-freeze response. It can happen to anyone, though people with certain conditions (e.g. autism, sensory processing disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia) are more vulnerable to it as they are often especially sensitive to external stimuli.
				</p><p>For people who have never experienced sensory overload, it might seem like a person is struggling for no apparent reason. I wanted to design a game to help players understand what it’s like to experience sensory overload and how it makes even simple tasks much more difficult.
				 </p>
				<h2 class="subheading">Inspiring Empathy through Game Design</h2>
				<p>Overloaded is a bullet hell in which you play as an autistic child struggling to maintain concentration on their schoolwork. I opted to create a bullet hell because the genre typically evokes feelings of frustration and overwhelm.
				</p><p>While the player dodges bullets (which represent the overwhelming sensory input), they must also hit a button when it lights up green (representing the student doing their schoolwork). If the player is hit by too many bullets, they lose focus and are temporarily unable to hit the schoolwork button. They receive a grade at the end of the game based on how many times they successfully hit the schoolwork button while it was green.
				</p><p>The schoolwork button lights up at random intervals between one and three seconds. This stops the player from finding a steady rhythm, making it so they have to actively pay attention to both the button and the bullet hell. Hitting the schoolwork button at the correct times is a simple task by itself but it becomes difficult when the player’s concentration is split. This parallels the autistic student’s experience – doing otherwise easy tasks becomes hard when they’re distracted by excessive sensory input.
				</p><p>The difficulty of each stage correlates to how badly that particular sensory input affects the student – the more the student is overwhelmed by sensory overload, the more overwhelmed the player will be.
