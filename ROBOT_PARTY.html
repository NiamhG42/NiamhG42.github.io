			<p class="align-me-center-text">Robot Party is a short, humourous text adventure about a disguised robot trying to make friends at a human party, which I made in 2 weeks using Twine. My goal for this project was to identify the key components of an "interesting" decision and then make a game with as many interesting decisions as possible.
			</p>
			<p>Based on my research into other text adventures and narrative games, I determined that an interesting decision should be impactful and informed, without being obvious. I also decided to avoid decisions that immediately result in failure states.
			</p>
			<h2>Impactful</h2>
			<p>The game meaningfully reacts to players' choices so players feel like their choices matter. I designed most decisions to have immediate responses, so players see the results of their actions straight away. Many decisions also have lasting consequences (e.g. which book players choose to read at the start unlocks different dialogue options throughout the rest of the game). This shows players their choices can have a wider impact over the entire game, and increases replayability by making the various routes through the game more distinct.
			</p>
			<h2>Informed</h2>
			<p>Players should have a reasonable chance of predicting what might happen as a result of their choices. To achieve this, I provided players with enough information to make informed decisions and ensured the links between decisions and outcomes were logical. My aim was to avoid players feeling clueless and guessing randomly, or feeling blindsided by a completely unpredictable result.
			</p>
			<h2>Not Obvious</h2>
			<p>While players should feel informed, there also shouldn't be a blindly obvious "correct" decision as this isn't challenging or engaging. I designed various decisions as fun tests of players' skills (e.g. players can use their memory, observational skills and emotional intelligence to predict whether the upset girl would appreciate a comforting hug or some space to herself). I also incorporated decisions with multiple valid options, so players could express themselves and there wasn't one "correct" path through the story.
			</p>
			<p>Occasionally, I purposefully made exceptions to the "not obvious" rule. For instance, sometimes the right thing to do to make friends with someone is obvious but the other options are funny and/or intriguing enough that the player might be tempted to pick them to see what happens. I paid extra attention to these exceptions during playtests to ensure the decisions remained interesting. Where necessary, I reworked options to make them more tempting until roughly 30% (or more) of my testers picked the "wrong but interesting" options.
			</p>
			<h2>No Sudden Failure</h2>
			<p>It's important that players can fail (otherwise their decisions don't feel like they matter) but it can be frustrating when a single wrong decision leads to a "game over" screen. To avoid this, I gave players opportunities to redeem themselves after bad decisions (e.g. the sporty guys won't like it if they find out you're only pretending to like football, but they'll be sympathetic if you're honest about why you lied).
