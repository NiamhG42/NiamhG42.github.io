			<p>Robot Party is a short, humourous text adventure about a disguised robot trying to make friends at a human party, which I made in two weeks using Twine. My goal for this project was to identify the key components of an "interesting" decision and then make a game with as many interesting decisions as possible.
 			</p>

			<p>Based on my research into other text adventures and narrative games, I determined that an interesting decision should be impactful and informed, without being obvious. I also decided to avoid decisions that immediately result in failure states.
			</p>

			<h2>Impactful</h2>
			<p>The game meaningfully reacts to players' choices. Most decisions have immediate responses, while some also have lasting consequences. Players can see that their choices matter, in both the short and long term. As well as making decisions more interesting, having impactful decisions increases replayability as it means thereâ€™s multiple distinct routes through the game to explore.
			</p>

			<h2>Informed</h2>
			<p>Players should have a reasonable chance of predicting what might happen as a result of their choices. To achieve this, I provided players with enough information to make informed decisions and ensured the links between decisions and outcomes were logical. My aim was to avoid players feeling clueless and guessing randomly, or feeling blindsided by a completely unpredictable result.
			</p>

			<h2>Not Obvious</h2>
			<p>While players should feel informed, there also shouldn't be a blindly obvious "correct" decision as this isn't challenging or engaging. I designed various decisions as fun tests of players' skills. I also incorporated decisions with multiple valid options, so players could express themselves and there wasn't one "correct" path through the story.
			</p>
					<img  src="images\Sustainimals\ScreenshotSustainimals.jpg" class="align-me-center-header-image">
			<p>Occasionally, I purposefully made exceptions to the "not obvious" rule. For instance, sometimes the right thing to do to make friends with someone is obvious but the other options are funny and/or intriguing enough that players might be tempted to pick them to see what happens. I paid extra attention to these exceptions during playtests to ensure the decisions remained interesting. Where necessary, I reworked options until roughly 30% (or more) of my testers picked the "wrong but interesting" options.
			</p>

			<h2>No Sudden Failure</h2>
			<p>It's important that players can fail (otherwise their decisions don't feel like they matter) but it can be frustrating when a single wrong decision leads to an abrupt "game over" screen. To avoid this, I gave players opportunities to redeem themselves after bad decisions.
