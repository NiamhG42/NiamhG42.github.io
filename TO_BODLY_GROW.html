			<p>To Boldly Grow is a work-in-progress game that combines systemic gameplay with a relaxing farming simulator.
			</p>
			<p>My goal was to design a system where players can breed their own plant species, which are meaningfully and interestingly distinct in appearance and behaviour. Plants also interact systemically with each other, the environment and the player.
			</p>
			<h2 class="subheading">Core Gameplay Loop</h2>
			<p>The player, as an alien botanist, can analyse plant specimens to discover their properties, crossbreed plants to create new species, and trade their harvested plants for resources to upgrade their farm. Their ultimate goal is to breed the perfect plants to terraform the barren world below their research station into a habitable planet.
			</p>

			<h2 class="subheading">Making Interesting and Varied Plants using Plant Stats</h2>
			<p>Each plant has a set of stats that govern its appearance and its systemic interactions with the player and the environment (including other plants). I designed these stats with a focus on allowing the player to create interesting and varied plants.
			</p>
			<p>Plants’ properties are measured from one to twenty along five different “stat spectrums”. This allows for a vast number of different stat combinations, which creates great variance in the behaviour and appearance of plant species.
			</p>
			<img  src="images\ToBoldlyGrow\ToBoldlyGrow2.gif" class="align-me-center-image">
			
			<p>Plants are designed modularly to facilitate a diverse range of possible appearances. Each plant is composed of separate parts that can be textured differently and swapped around in different combinations based on a plant’s stats.
			</p><p>Originally, each stat was on a simple scale where a low value only indicated the plant was lacking in that property (e.g. a “0 invasive” plant is a plant with no invasive properties). However, this meant low values weren’t interesting as they were simply the absence of an engaging trait.
			</p><p>I replaced the one-stat scale with a spectrum between two different stats. This means stats are inversely proportional (e.g. if a plant is less invasive, it’s more cannibalistic). Plants are more interesting at every point along the spectrum because they are always defined by an active trait, rather than the absence of one.
			</p>
			<img  src="images\ToBoldlyGrow\ToBoldlyGrow3.png" class="align-me-center-image">
			
			<p>I also gave “middling” stats their own properties, to make sure plants weren’t only engaging at the extreme ends of the stat spectrums. For instance, highly electric plants produce electricity, can charge automations and might shock players if incautiously watered. Mid-range electric plants don’t produce electricity but do conduct electricity, so they behave like highly electric plants when in a circuit with them.
			</p>
			<h2 class="subheading">Crossbreeding to Create New Species</h2>
			<p>The botany system allows players to systemically create new species of plants with different stats.
			</p><p>I designed a formula to determine the “child” plant’s stats when two “parent” plants are crossbred. A child’s stats are roughly halfway between the parents’ stats. Inspired by real genetics, each stat spectrum is tagged as either “Dominant” or “Recessive”. This mechanic potentially weighs the child plant’s stats towards one parent or the other.
			</p><p>Once the formula has calculated the child plant’s stats and whether they are dominant or recessive, there is a small chance that mutation will occur. This slightly alters the stats of the child plant to introduce a small element of random variance into the crossbreeding process.
