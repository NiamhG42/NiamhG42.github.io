				<p>The design objective of Sustainimals is to make learning about serious topics fun and therefore make the lesson more effective.
				</p><p>
				The game is split between town-building, as the player helps rebuild a village after natural disaster, and gaining the resources to rebuild by playing educational minigames. Each minigame has a simple, clear message about a different way you can contribute towards sustainable food systems.
				</p><p>
				It can be hard (especially for children) to understand abstract concepts and how your actions have an impact on people you’ll never meet. So, I incorporated the learning directly into the gameplay. The core game loop draws an explicit link between:
				</p><p>
				• The student doing what they can to contribute towards more sustainable food systems in real life.
				</p><p>
				• Other people having access to more resources and being able to reduce their food insecurity.
				</p><p>
				Playtests with primary school students indicate the game succeeds in being both educational and fun; the students were able to clearly explain the concept of food sustainability and what actions they could take to help – and 93.8% of the students who played the game said they’d play it again!
