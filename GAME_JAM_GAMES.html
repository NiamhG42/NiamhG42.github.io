			<p>I made 1 2 2 Bang! in ten days, working in a team of two. I designed the game as a couch co-op minigame adaption of a classic group counting exercise.
 			</p>
			
			<p>The players hold down their button and release it to "count". If multiple people count at the same time, they're eliminated. The longer the players hold, the more points they score when they release. But another player could steal their potential points by releasing first! The first player past the finish line wins.

					<div class="image-description">There are multiple branching paths through the game to explore, all depending on players’ decisions.

			<h2 class="subheading">Impactful</h2>
			<p>The game meaningfully reacts to players' choices. Most decisions have immediate responses, while some also have lasting consequences. Players can see that their choices matter, in both the short and long term. As well as making decisions more interesting, having impactful decisions increases replayability as it means there’s multiple distinct routes through the game to explore.

					<div class="image-description">Different dialogue options are unlocked based on players’ earlier choices, e.g. which book they chose to read at the start of the game.
					</div>
			<h2 class="subheading">Informed</h2>
			<p>Players should have a reasonable chance of predicting what might happen as a result of their choices. To achieve this, I provided players with enough information to make informed decisions and ensured the links between decisions and outcomes were logical. My aim was to avoid players feeling clueless and guessing randomly, or feeling blindsided by a completely unpredictable result.
			</p>

					<div class="image-description">Players are given contextual clues as to what might happen as a result of their choices, e.g. the dog has retreated from the staring player character and shown discomfort at their excessive attention.
					</div>
			<h2 class="subheading">Not Obvious</h2>
			<p>While players should feel informed, there also shouldn't be a blindly obvious "correct" decision as this isn't challenging or engaging. I designed various decisions as fun tests of players' skills. I also incorporated decisions with multiple valid options, so players could express themselves and there wasn't one "correct" path through the story.
			</p>

					<div class="image-description">Players can use their memory, observational skills and emotional intelligence to predict, based on their previous interactions with Caroline, whether she’d appreciate physical contact or not.
					</div>
			<p>Occasionally, I purposefully made exceptions to the "not obvious" rule. For instance, sometimes the right thing to do to make friends with someone is obvious but the other options are funny and/or intriguing enough that players might be tempted to pick them to see what happens. I paid extra attention to these exceptions during playtests to ensure the decisions remained interesting. Where necessary, I reworked options until roughly 30% (or more) of my testers picked the "wrong but interesting" options.
			</p>
			<h2 class="subheading">No Sudden Failure</h2>
			<p>It's important that players can fail (otherwise their decisions don't feel like they matter) but it can be frustrating when a single wrong decision leads to an abrupt "game over" screen. To avoid this, I gave players opportunities to redeem themselves after bad decisions.
