			<p>I made 1 2 2 Bang! in ten days, working in a team of two. I designed the game as a couch co-op minigame adaption of a classic group counting exercise.
 			</p>

			
			<p>The players hold down their button and release it to "count". If multiple people count at the same time, they're eliminated. The longer the players hold, the more points they score when they release. But another player could steal their potential points by releasing first! The first player past the finish line wins.
			</p>
			
						<p>My primary focus was on making the simple gameplay feel "juicy", responsive and rewarding. To increase tension, I used a heartbeat soundtrack and had the player characters visibly shake while buttons were held down. To enhance the impact of the players’ actions, I made eliminations into a screen-shaking explosion that leaves behind the eliminated character’s bloody remains.

		<p>A Game About A Game About A Game... was made in two days by a team of four for Global Game Jam 2021.</p>
		<p>My goal was to make a meta platformer that reflected the game development process. When the "game development" is going well, the quality of the assets improves and the player has access to more abilities. When the "game development" process stalls, the quality of the game assets decreases and the player loses access to certain game mechanics.</p>
		<p>A significant part of my learning from this project was how to best communicate with and support a composer, as this was my first time working with a musician composing original music for a game.</p>

		<p>I worked with three students of TU Dublin’s International Business & Languages course, who had never made a game before, to produce Numbers Game in two days for TU Dublin Game Jam 2022.</p>
		<p>The game is designed to help players learn to count in German, Polish and French. In the game, there is a grid of tiles marked by numerals. Random tiles are “threatened” and the player must select a safe tile by clicking a corresponding button, which is labelled with the number in words (e.g. The “quatre” button selects tile 4). The game increases in difficulty by increasing the number of tiles and, eventually, by changing the order of the buttons so the player has to actually recognise the number (instead of relying on 3 being 3rd in position and so on).</p>
		<p>My main focus for this project was to learn from the process of producing a game on a deadline with an inexperienced team and improve my teamwork skills by working with people I wouldn't often work with.</p>
